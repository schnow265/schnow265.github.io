# My NixOS Setup

Keep it simple for the TL;DR & preview:

I use two systems with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/schnow265/dotfiles) on the ``develop`` branch:

- A WSL NixOS install at work
- A bare metal NixOS install at home

<!-- more -->

But that's not it. On my home machine there are some more settings I changed:

- I enabled libvirtd and qemu
- Tailscale, OpenSSH and flatpaks are enabled

## Benchmarks

My machine at home is statistically worse than my work machine, but through my weird benchmark called "Compiling the Linux Kernel with 8 cores" I found out that my home machine is... faster?

> every compile was run after a ``make clean`` with the config generated by ``make defconfig``

| CPU/Cores | time needed to compile |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Ryzen 5 3500U / 8 Cores | 17 min 30 sec |


I am gonna call this the "WSL Overhead"
