# My obsession with debugging

well this is gonna be akward...

<!-- more -->

If you ever give me a somewhat working programm, you might see me running a debugger over it.

I have a somewhat crazy obsession with debugging & messing with code that I find on the internet.

Examples include: 

- Minecraft (via FabricMC)
- The Linux Kernel (with the good 'ol GDB scripts)

I don't primarily learn what a programm does by looking at it's code. 
My main knowledge about how something runs is by setting breakpoints on interesting methods and just running the debugger over it.

Have you ever had the feeling "I have no idea what this is doing, but I think I know it"?
This is the feeling that I get when finding out how something works by debugging.

Also most stuff I debugged I either

1. had the sources
2. were written in Java so that fernflower could kick in and decomile the bytecode

So that knd of invalidates my results.
