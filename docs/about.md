## About me

The name is schnow265. Developer by trade.

### My Experience

I have collected experience during my years of developing and just attaching debuggers to existing software.

I have worked in the following programming languages:

- C#
- Java
- Python
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Nix

I also have _a bit_ of experience with Linux Systems, since my computer at home is running Linux.

### Other Hobbies

I also like to read books on the side and often watch movies. Some of my favourite Authros include Stephen King and Ursula Poznanski.
